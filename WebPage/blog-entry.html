		<h2>SixthSense - Bringing intangible, digital information out into the tangible world</h2>
		<div class="panel panel-default">
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p class="text-primary"><tab1>When we encounter something, someone or some place, we use our five natural senses to perceive information about it; that information helps us make decisions and chose the right actions to take. But arguably the most useful information that can help us make the right decision is not naturally perceivable with our five senses, namely the data, information and knowledge that mankind has accumulated about everything and which is increasingly all available online. Although the miniaturization of computing devices allows us to carry computers in our pockets, keeping us continually connected to the digital world, there is no link between our digital devices and our interactions with the physical world. Information is confined traditionally on paper or digitally on a screen. SixthSense bridges this gap, bringing intangible, digital information out into the tangible world, and allowing us to interact with this information via natural hand gestures. ‘SixthSense’ frees information from its confines by seamlessly integrating it with reality, and thus making the entire world your computer.</tab1></p> 
				<p class="text-primary"><tab1>Interaction with physical objects plays a wide role in everyday life. Each day we interact with multiple objects. When we talk about physical things, one other thing comes attached to it. The other thing is gestures. Gestures determine how we manipulate the these physical objects. We use gestures not only to interact with these objects, but we also use them to interact with peer human beings. For example, playing a piano, holding a subway pole for support, a handshake, etc.</tab1></p> 
				<p class="text-primary"><tab1>Sixth sense technology integrates digital information into the physical worlds and its objects, making the entire world your computer. This technology is combination of hand gesture recognition, image capturing, processing, and manipulation, etc. </tab1></p>
				<p class="text-primary"><tab1>The SixthSense prototype is comprised of a pocket projector, a mirror and a camera. The hardware components are coupled in a pendant like mobile wearable device. Both the projector and the camera are connected to the mobile computing device in the user`s pocket. The projector projects visual information enabling surfaces, walls and physical objects around us to be used as interfaces; while the camera recognizes and tracks user`s hand gestures and physical objects using computer-vision based techniques. The software program processes the video stream data captured by the camera and tracks the locations of the colored markers (visual tracking fiducials) at the tip of the user`s fingers using simple computer-vision techniques. The movements and arrangements of these fiducials are interpreted into gestures that act as interaction instructions for the projected application interfaces. The maximum number of tracked fingers is only constrained by the number of unique fiducials, thus SixthSense also supports multi-touch and multi-user interaction.</tab1></p>
